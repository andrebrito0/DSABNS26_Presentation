# Coupling Environmental Exposure and Human Mobility in an SEIR Metapopulation Model of Influenza Transmission
### DSABNS 2026 Presentation

This repository contains the simulation code, analysis scripts, and LaTeX Beamer slides for my presentation at the **17th Conference on Dynamical Systems and Applications to Biology and Natural Sciences (DSABNS 2026)**.

## 📌 Overview

We investigate how different functional forms of environmental forcing (temperature dependence) affect the timing and intensity of respiratory infection peaks. By comparing **Sigmoid**, **Gaussian**, and **Exponential** modulation of contact rates against a constant null model, we demonstrate that sigmoid seasonality is required to synchronize simulated epidemics with empirical hospital urgency data.

**Key Metrics Analyzed:**
* **Attack Rate (AR):** Total cumulative infections.
* **Peak Timing:** Synchronization with the winter window.
